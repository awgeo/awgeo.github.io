Digging around on the Internet Archive, I found my very first website - the North Ayrshire Amateur Swimming Club - for which I proudly got my first domain, naswim.com. 
 
It's missing a few images but the design isn't nearly as over the top as I remember it - in fact, it's surpsingly tasetful. Mind you, this version is missing the waving Scottish flag gifs and the water ripple effect as you moused over the club logo (which I remember took ages to load and didn't work on everyone's Netscape browsers, but I wasn't going to let that hold me back).

It looks like I started it in January 2001... when I was fifteen. I think I managed it for a couple of years before handing it over. It was prone to redesign and was probably "offline for maintenance" more often than not.
 
We had a members-only area that was secured with a password hidden way down at the bottom of the HTML file. No one would ever think to look there!

In fact, I still remember the website where I made all the signage: <a href="http://www.cooltext.com/" target="_blank">Cool Text Graphics Generator</a>. I'm amazed it still exists! Disappointing to see the counter didn't survive, though.

Anyway, that was my teenage years!
