I've managed to exhausted DataCamp.com of all 25 courses on SQL programming, covering both SQL Server and PostgreSQL. It has kept me busy for 9-weeks of coronavirus lockdown, while on furlough from work. Since each course takes about 4 hours, that's a good 100 hours of coding, plus their one short SQL "project" working with data from The World Bank. 

I also managed to get "100th percentile" in DataCamp's Signal Assessment on Data Analysis in PostgreSQL (after a few attempts... I couldn't let it sit at 96% or 98%). The skeptic in me wonders if I really did better than 100% of takers, or if there's some rounding involved!

Some of these courses comprise the Data Analyst with SQL Server "Career Track" on DataCamp, which it says follows the curriculum for the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-461.aspx">Microsoft certification exam 70-461: Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012/2014</a>. This seems like a good next step to keep pushing myself to improve my SQL skills, but it seems Microsoft are retiring this exam on January 31, 2021 in favour more career-based certification (as opposed to specific technical skills). I think I'll aim to do it anyway, as it will force me to keep the ball rolling over the next few months.

As I write this, there are four more SQL courses under development on DataCamp. Of these, I'm particularly looking forward to the 'PostgreSQL course on Time Series Analysis' course. I've got experience working with time series data, such as historical oil and gas production rates, in Python and Pandas and I'm keen to learn more about how to work with this data in SQL.
