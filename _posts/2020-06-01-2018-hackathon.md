Back in November 2018 I attended the <a href="https://events.agilescientific.com/event/oga-lon-hackathon">Oil & Gas Authority (OGA) Hackathon in London</a>. My python programming skills have come a long way since then and now, having just completed a taught course on Machine Learning, I'm able to take a look back at our project <a href="https://github.com/Nozziel/OGA2018_SweetSpotPrediction">GitHub repo</a> make better sense of it.

My team of five, the "SweetSpot SweatShop", worked on a project to predict reservoir sweet spots based on assortment of reservoir property maps. A SweetSpot, for the purpose of this project, is an area where favourable reservoir conditions stack up: NTG (facies), porosity and permeability (quality), net reservoir (above contact), and thickness (hc column).

We used the example dataset for Petrel software, the Gulfaks field reservoir model, to create a suite of reservoir property maps (thickness, NTG, etc.) as input features to the machine learning algorithm (Random Forest Classifier). 

Training and validation data was provided in the form of 'sweet spot maps', manually interpreted in Petrel. The ML model was used to predict sweet spots for many realisations of input maps, and to communicate most-likely and uncertainty estimates for sweet spots.

The results show that the current model performance at ROC/AUC score 0.75 and F1 score of 0.52. It was proposed that the performance of the model might be improved by (1) acquiring data from different fields as additional training data, (2) switching to deep learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) to improve performance, (3) Feature Engineering.
